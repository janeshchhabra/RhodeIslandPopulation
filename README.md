# Rhode Island Population Visualization
This project is a geospatial mapping of Rhode Island populations. It is based on Census Tract data. In order to create the topojson file used for this project, I downloaded Rhode Island Census tract shp files, Rhode Island Census tract population csv, US County shp files, and US state shp files. I did the following to create the file:

* Use QGIS on the county shp files to isolate Rhode Island and save that as a new shp file
* Use QGIS on the county shp files to isolate Rhode Island and save that as a new shp file
